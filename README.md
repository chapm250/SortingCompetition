# SortingCompetition
# This was a sorting competition that me and my partner worked on
# We had to sort integers that were either 0 or 1. First by the sum of all the numbers contained in the string ex: 0011 
# would be 2. Then alphabetically 0 being lower than 1. Then by the length of the string ex 000011 would be 6
# my team scored 3rd place in my class of 16 teams using a combination of bucketsort and the built in quicksort
